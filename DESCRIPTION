Description: Obtain information on peak flow data from the National River Flow Archive (NRFA) in the United Kingdom, either from the Peak Flow Dataset files <https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/peak-flow-dataset> once these have been downloaded to the user's computer or using the NRFA's API. These files are in a format suitable for direct use in the 'WINFAP' software, hence the name of the package.
